# Description

Difficulty Origins is a mod that adds in a new origins layer for difficulty options. This will allow players on an SMP world to pick and choose how difficult they want the game to be.

# Origins

- Standard
  - The default way of playing Minecraft.
- Peaceful
  - Most mobs will ignore you and you will keep items on death.
- Easy
  - You will keep items on death.
- Inconvenient
  - You cannot sleep or set a spawn point with a bed.
- Hard
  - You cannot regenerate health passively.
- Difficult
  - You cannot sleep nor passively regenerate health.
- Impossible
  - You have one heart, _and_ you can't sleep or regenerate health.

(Both Difficult and Impossible provide a free Orb of Origin for frustrated players.)
